        "## Background\n",
        "In 1978, logician Raymond Smullyan published “What is the name of this book?”, a book of logical puzzles. Among the puzzles in the book were a class of puzzles that Smullyan called “Knights and Knaves” puzzles.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, the following information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a simple puzzle with just a single character named A. A says “I am both a knight and a knave.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Logically, we might reason that if A were a knight, then that sentence would have to be true. But we know that the sentence cannot possibly be true, because A cannot be both a knight and a knave – we know that each character is either a knight or a knave, but not both. So, we could conclude, A must be a knave.\n",
        "\n",
        "That puzzle was on the simpler side. With more characters and more sentences, the puzzles can get trickier! Your task in this problem is to determine how to represent these puzzles using propositional logic, such that an AI running a model-checking algorithm could solve these puzzles for us."

Each person carries two versions of the gene, so each person has the potential to possess either 0, 1, or 2 copies of the hearing impairment version GJB2. Unless a person undergoes genetic testing, though, it’s not so easy to know how many copies of mutated GJB2 a person has. This is some “hidden state”: information that has an effect that we can observe (hearing impairment), but that we don’t necessarily directly know. After all, some people might have 1 or 2 copies of mutated GJB2 but not exhibit hearing impairment, while others might have no copies of mutated GJB2 yet still exhibit hearing impairment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every child inherits one copy of the GJB2 gene from each of their parents. If a parent has two copies of the mutated gene, then they will pass the mutated gene on to the child; if a parent has no copies of the mutated gene, then they will not pass the mutated gene on to the child; and if a parent has one copy of the mutated gene, then the gene is passed on to the child with probability 0.5. After a gene is passed on, though, it has some probability of undergoing additional mutation: changing from a version of the gene that causes hearing impairment to a version that doesn’t, or vice versa.\n",

Notice that the first row defines the columns for this CSV file: name, mother, father, and trait.

Lily, on the other hand, also has no parents listed in the data set, but does not exhibit the trait (as indicated by the 0 in the trait cell).\n",

        "Open up heredity.py and take a look first at the definition of PROBS. PROBS is a dictionary containing a number of constants representing probabilities of various different events. All of these events have to do with how many copies of a particular gene a person has (hereafter referred to as simply “the gene”), and whether a person exhibits a particular trait (hereafter referred to as “the trait”) based on that gene. The data here is loosely based on the probabilities for the hearing impairment version of the GJB2 gene and the hearing impairment trait, but by changing these values, you could use your AI to draw inferences about other genes and traits as well!\n",
        "\n",
        "First, PROBS[\"gene\"] represents the unconditional probability distribution over the gene (i.e., the probability if we know nothing about that person’s parents). Based on the data in the distribution code, it would seem that in the population, there’s a 1% chance of having 2 copies of the gene, a 3% chance of having 1 copy of the gene, and a 96% chance of having 0 copies of the gene.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, PROBS[\"trait\"] represents the conditional probability that a person exhibits a trait (like hearing impairment). This is actually three different probability distributions: one for each possible value for gene. So PROBS[\"trait\"][2] is the probability distribution that a person has the trait given that they have two versions of the gene: in this case, they have a 65% chance of exhibiting the trait, and a 35% chance of not exhibiting the trait. Meanwhile, if a person has 0 copies of the gene, they have a 1% chance of exhibiting the trait, and a 99% chance of not exhibiting the trait.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, PROBS[\"mutation\"] is the probability that a gene mutates from being the gene in question to not being that gene, and vice versa. If a mother has two versions of the gene, for example, and therefore passes one on to her child, there’s a 1% chance it mutates into not being the target gene anymore. Conversely, if a mother has no versions of the gene, and therefore does not pass it onto her child, there’s a 1% chance it mutates into being the target gene. It’s therefore possible that even if neither parent has any copies of the gene in question, their child might have 1 or even 2 copies of the gene.\n",

Your task in this project is to implement three functions to do just that: joint_probability to compute a joint probability, update to add the newly computed joint probability to the existing probability distribution, and then normalize to ensure all probability distributions sum to 1 at the end.\n",

        "We will here show the calculation of joint_probability(people, {\"Harry\"}, {\"James\"}, {\"James\"}). Based on the arguments, one_gene is {\"Harry\"}, two_genes is {\"James\"}, and has_trait is {\"James\"}. This therefore represents the probability that: Lily has 0 copies of the gene and does not have the trait, Harry has 1 copy of the gene and does not have the trait, and James has 2 copies of the gene and does have the trait.\n",
        "\n",
        "We start with Lily (the order that we consider people does not matter, so long as we multiply the correct values together, since multiplication is commutative). Lily has 0 copies of the gene with probability 0.96 (this is PROBS[\"gene\"][0]). Given that she has 0 copies of the gene, she doesn’t have the trait with probability 0.99 (this is PROBS[\"trait\"][0][False]). Thus, the probability that she has 0 copies of the gene and she doesn’t have the trait is 0.96 * 0.99 = 0.9504.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we consider James. James has 2 copies of the gene with probability 0.01 (this is PROBS[\"gene\"][2]). Given that he has 2 copies of the gene, the probability that he does have the trait is 0.65. Thus, the probability that he has 2 copies of the gene and he does have the trait is 0.01 * 0.65 = 0.0065.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we consider Harry. What’s the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene? There are two ways this can happen. Either he gets the gene from his mother and not his father, or he gets the gene from his father and not his mother. His mother Lily has 0 copies of the gene, so Harry will get the gene from his mother with probability 0.01 (this is PROBS[\"mutation\"]), since the only way to get the gene from his mother is if it mutated; conversely, Harry will not get the gene from his mother with probability 0.99. His father James has 2 copies of the gene, so Harry will get the gene from his father with probability 0.99 (this is 1 - PROBS[\"mutation\"]), but will get the gene from his mother with probability 0.01 (the chance of a mutation). Both of these cases can be added together to get 0.99 * 0.99 + 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.9802, the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that Harry has 1 copy of the gene, the probability that he does not have the trait is 0.44 (this is PROBS[\"trait\"][1][False]). So the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene and does not have the trait is 0.9802 * 0.44 = 0.431288.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the entire joint probability is just the result of multiplying all of these values for each of the three people: 0.9504 * 0.0065 * 0.431288 = 0.0026643247488.\n",

        "### Hints\n",
        "* Recall that to compute a joint probability of multiple events, you can do so by multiplying those probabilities together. But remember that for any child, the probability of them having a certain number of genes is conditional on what genes their parents have.\n"
